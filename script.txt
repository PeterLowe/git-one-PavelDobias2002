GIT

Init
The init code command initialized empty repository in my student folder 
We can check this by going the address of the repository and showing hidden files (.git)

Add
The add code command will add all the files in the folder, we can check this with status command
The git add . adds all files, if we want to specify we use: git add <name of the file>

Status
I used status command when showing the add command, but what it does Is that it shows the status of the folder in which we are using the git bash 

Commit
The commit command sets “milestones” in the project timeline, something we can come back in later
There is Committer: in this instance me
We can see that the commit name is first_commit, then we have info about committer and we can see that all the files in the folder were changed

Remote
The git remote add <name> <url> is used to add remote server to the folder we are using the git bash in
We can check what remote servers we have by using git remote -v

Push
Git push updates remote node with current node that we are using, we are pushing local nodes to the remote ones 
To push we need to complete authentication in browser and needs to be associated remote node
In this instance its: origin main which we created in before using git remote add 

Branch
We use git branch name_of_the_branch to create sequence of commit points which needs to be merged to main

Checkout
We use the git checkout branch_name to switch to that branch from current one

Merge
We use git merge branch_name to merge branches to main 

Log
Git log displays commit history
Here we can see who did the commit, what was committed and the name of the comit

Clone
git clone copies existing repository, creating new copy of it in different folder
to clone we open different folder in it we open git bash and we use the url of the reposiotry we want to copy to that folder
